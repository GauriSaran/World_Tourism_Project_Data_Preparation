# World_Tourism_Project_Data_Preparation
Data Preparation: Cleaning the messy World toursm data 
## Overview
In this project a real-world business problem has been solved by applying numpy and pandas python libaries. The requirements and guidance are from Practical SAS Programming course on Coursera.

### Background Information
To demonstart ability to acquire, organize, and prepare data into a format suitable for a business analyst to use. The business analyst will use the prepared data to create reports, visualizations, and statistical models designed to grow company’s market share.

### Tasks Completed:
The given tourism data is not in a format ready for nalysis, and to prepare the data correctly it is needed to follow the requirements in the case study that include:
* reorganizing the data
* creating new columns
* converting character columns to numeric
* converting character case
* dropping unnecessary columns
* changing column names as appropriate for analysis
* create and applying a custom format
* merging data
* visualizing prepared data

### Business Problem
The company is interested in analyzing 2014 global tourism data. Two data sets have been received with a list of data requirements and the desired outcome. Task is to follow the given requirements and prepare the data for use.

### Data
As mentioned in the SAS course on Coursera: "The raw data was downloaded from the UN data website."
This project is a replica of the project completed by me in my SAS training course, Practical SAS Programming and Certification Review on Coursera. This project is an initiative to complete the same project in Python using Pandas library to demonstrate my skills in Data Cleaning and Data Preparation for conducting statistical analysis on the data.

### Outcome
Three tables are to be delivered upon successful completion of the project:
• cleaned_tourism
• final_tourism
• nocountryfound
Specifications for these tables have been described in the accompanying python Jupytr notebook file.
